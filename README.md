# Rap_Recommendation

### Motivation
  With my Spotify playing something ~75% of my day, often times I run out of new music. I have always been interested in how songs are being recommended for me, thinking about the features of my current song and seeing how that compares to what is played next. How is a set of songs being recommended for me based off of my playlist? What did I listen to recently that made my Discover Weekly this good/bad?
